## One page

### Concept: one page scroll experience

### One page scroll libraries

* [One Page Scroll](https://github.com/peachananr/onepage-scroll)

## General

## Aspects

### Static / adjusting section height or full screen sections

* [Maje full screen sections with 1 line of CSS](https://medium.com/@ckor/make-full-screen-sections-with-1-line-of-css-b82227c75cbd#.fpuxlqwdk)
* [Using jQuery to adjust height dynamically](http://jsfiddle.net/senff/WdF89/1/
)
* [Stretching a section of a page to full height and width](https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/stretch-a-section-of-page-to-full-height-and-width/)


### Dynamic / animations over visible sections

* [Alvaro Trigo's callback example](http://www.taboca.com/dd/fullPage.js-master/examples/callbacks.html) shows how animation, and other JavaScript behaviour, can be triggered when the section becomes viewed.

### Responsiveness

TBD  

### Fixed fullscreen background

In Alvaro Trigo’s fullPage, the [Fixed Fullscreen Background example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/backgrounds.html) will bring a new slide that has a fixed background.  

### Managed scrolling

#### Bring back the standard scrollbar behaviour

Alvaro Trigo’s One Section example shows how to isolate a given section out of the full page behaviour, which can be a desired use case to provide the standard scrollbar behaviour. From the documentation, he claims “Just place the rest of your page after the fullpage wrapper and use the option `fitToSection:false` and `autoScrolling:false`. And enjoy a great single slider.”

#### Scrolling and fixing content

* [Scroll-Then-Fix Content](https://css-tricks.com/scroll-fix-content/) uses a search top bar demonstration to show the general idea which depends on maintaining two states when the user scrolls down the page. A main, top-level larger search is first displayed, and, as the scrollbar position passes certain threshold, then a JavaScript function switches the stage of an element using DOM CSS operations.

* TBD Check if **Scrolling with fixed content** is the same thing — the case in which you are navigating (say) slides when suddenly some parts of the page gets fixed, til a further slide section down the page.

#### Scrolling speed, animation and magnets

In many modern pages, the behaviour of scroll is being modified. In Alvaro Trigo’s fullPage.js, the demos related are: [Easing demo](http://www.taboca.com/dd/fullPage.js-master/examples/easing.html) and [Scrolling speed](http://www.taboca.com/dd/fullPage.js-master/examples/scrollingSpeed.html).
